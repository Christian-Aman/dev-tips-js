# Dev Tips JS
When i started learning javascript I knew some thing I didn't know, but it hit me that there is som many thing i dont even know I dont know. So the idea with Dev Tips JS is that it will be a user generated index of good sources of articles, tutorials and blogposts that they found useful.
